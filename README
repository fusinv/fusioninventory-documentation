First, thank you!

To know which file need to be refresh we use a timestamp
mecanism.

To know what need to be done, run:
 ./tools/findTodo.pl <language>
The tool will give you a list of file to synchronise.

Once a file is synchronised, you have to update its timestamp like that:
 ./updateStamp.pl thefile.dita
