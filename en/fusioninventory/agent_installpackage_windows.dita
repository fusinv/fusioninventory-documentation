  <shortdesc>How to install the agent under Windows</shortdesc>
  <body>
    <p>You have to download the installer package from the following  FusionInventory page:<xref href="http://prebuilt.fusioninventory.org/stable/windows-i386/" format="html">http://prebuilt.fusioninventory.org/stable/windows-i386/</xref></p>
    <p>You will just have to launch the installer for an interactive installation process.</p>
    <note>The installer contains an embedded version of Perl that was specially made for usage with FusionInventory. It&apos;s not necessary to additionally install Perl for this. The embedded perl doesn&apos;t conflict with another version that may be installed on the system.</note>
    <note>If you want to use the network discovery and nmap feature, you will have to install the Windows-version of nmap. You can find the most recent version here: <xref href="http://nmap.org/download.html" format="html">http://nmap.org/download.html</xref>.</note>
