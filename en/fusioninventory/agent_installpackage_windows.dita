  <shortdesc>How to install the FusionInventory agent using Windows installer.</shortdesc>
  <body>
    <p>You must download the installer package from the following  FusionInventory page:<xref href="http://prebuilt.fusioninventory.org/stable/windows-i386/" format="html">http://prebuilt.fusioninventory.org/stable/windows-i386/</xref></p>
    <p>You will just have to launch the installer for an interactive installation process.</p>
    <note>The installer contains an embedded version of Perl dedicated to the FusionInventory agent, therefore no additional Perl installation is required. The embedded Perl doesn&apos;t conflict with another version that may be installed on your system.</note>
    <note>If you plan on using the network discovery and the nmap feature, you will have to install the Windows-version of nmap. The latest version is available at: <xref href="http://nmap.org/download.html" format="html">http://nmap.org/download.html</xref>.</note>
