    <p>Some distributions like Debian do already have versions of the FusionInventory agent  in their distribution repositories - But they are more lilkely being older or even quite outdated.</p>
    <p>The FusionInventory developers  maintain a up-to-date DEB-Package of the most recent version in a extra repository. If you want to use it, you have to edit the following file:</p>
    <p><codeblock>/etc/apt/sources.list</codeblock></p>
    <p>Add the following line: <codeblock>deb http://debian.fusioninventory.org/debian/ stable main</codeblock></p>
    <p>Update the local package list:</p>
    <codeblock>apt-get update
or
aptitude update</codeblock>
    <p>List all the FusionInventory packages available:</p>
    <codeblock>apt-cache search fusioninventory</codeblock>
    <p>You will have to install the agent then with the command <i>apt-get install</i> to install the FusionInventory agent and its modules onto a machine.</p>
