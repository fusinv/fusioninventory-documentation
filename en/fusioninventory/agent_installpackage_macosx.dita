  <title>Using Mac OS X Installer</title>
  <shortdesc>Installation of the agent with the Mac OS X installer</shortdesc>
  <body>
    <p>The FusionInventory project provides two Mac OS X packages: one for powerpc computers and the other for Intel macs.</p>
    <p>The package is a .pkg file designed for silent installation. Agent&apos;s configuration needs to be done before installing, by going into the package, and edit the <i>Content\Resources\agent.cfg</i> file.</p>
    <p>By default, the agent runs as a daemon, and stores its files in /opt/fusioninventory-agent.</p>
    <p>Please note that FusionInventory agent is not a Mac OS X application, and as such is invisible for users.</p>
    <p>Once configured, the agent can be deployed either manually (by double clicking on the .pkg file), nor automatically using tools like Apple Remote Desktop.</p>
