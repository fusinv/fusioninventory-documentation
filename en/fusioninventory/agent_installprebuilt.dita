  <body>
    <p>There are also pre-compiled or pre-built versions of the agent maintained by the project. The idea is to launch the agent without installing anything on your system. Here are the steps : </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Download the pre-built version for your OS: <xref href="http://prebuilt.fusioninventory.org/stable/" format="html">http://prebuilt.fusioninventory.org/stable/</xref></li>
      <li>Uncompress the downloaded archive</li>
      <li>Configure the agent</li>
      <li>
        <p>Launch the agent with the following command:</p>
        <codeblock>./fusioninventory-agent</codeblock>
      </li>
    </ul>
