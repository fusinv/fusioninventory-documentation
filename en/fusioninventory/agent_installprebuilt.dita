  <shortdesc>How to install the FusionInventory agent using prebuilt agent</shortdesc>
  <body>
    <p>Prebuilt versions of the agent are also maintained by the project, allowing you to launch the agent without any installation on your system. The installation involves four steps :</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Download the prebuilt version for your OS: <xref href="http://prebuilt.fusioninventory.org/stable/" format="html">http://prebuilt.fusioninventory.org/stable/</xref></li>
      <li>Uncompress the downloaded archive</li>
      <li>Configure the agent by editing the agent.cfg file</li>
      <li>
        <p>Launch the agent with the following command as root :</p>
        <codeblock>./fusioninventory-agent</codeblock>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><note>the FusionInventory project recommends using packages (deb, rpm, etc.) when possible. Prebuilts are interesting for testing purposes, or when you have no possibility to install packages on your system.</note></p>
